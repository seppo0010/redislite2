Redislite was born with the idea of making a software library that implements a
self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, redis-compatible database
engine.

After some effort, I realized that the implementation I started was inviable,
with structural errors. Since the vision is still there, this is a Python
implementation of the project. The language was choosen to facilitate
development, refactoring with the goal of realize the algorithms and then
implement as a library in pure C.
